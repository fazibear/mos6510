# Changelog

## 0.1.3
Converted the JavaScript code to Ruby, so that we are no longer dependent on mini_racer.

## 0.1.2
Bumped versions of mini_racer so we can run on Ruby 3.1. Also bumped rspec.

## 0.1.1
Bumped version of mini_racer, as 0.2.6 doesn't want to compile and install on my Mac.

## 0.1.0
Just getting started...
